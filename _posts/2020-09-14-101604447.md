> Opening up the service industry and ensuring fair competition will not only improve productivity, create growth and employment opportunities, but also provide significant welfare benefits to the growing middle-class consumers.

Even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, seeking higher yields in a low-growth, low-interest-rate environment was a major challenge for the global economy. For most of the past decade, one-third of global growth came from China. However, as productivity growth slows and resource allocation efficiency still has room for improvement, China's growth rate is also stepping down.

One important source of future global growth is China's service industry and its service trade with the rest of the world. There are three reasons for this: compared to developed economies where the service industry accounts for more than 70% of GDP, China's service industry accounts for only 54%, which is still relatively low; compared to the double-digit productivity growth in China's manufacturing industry, the productivity growth in China's service industry is not high; and there are still significant entry barriers in many service sectors in China for both foreign and private enterprises.

Observing recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data, it can be seen that the impact of the pandemic on the service industry is more than twice that on the manufacturing industry. Therefore, on the road to recovery, there are great opportunities to reshape the service industry and promote service trade. Globally, service trade also presents growth opportunities. Barriers to service trade are three times higher than those to goods trade, with financial services, telecommunications, and healthcare being typical sectors.

The China International Fair for Trade in Services held in early September sent an important signal to the world: China is beginning to value the opening up of its service industry and trade.

Traditional service trade from China, such as tourism, supports the demand of many countries around the world. Chain hotels, travel companies, and duty-free shopping industries that heavily rely on Chinese consumers still hope to seize the opportunity of the growing wealth of Chinese citizens. According to the International Monetary Fund, China's comparative advantage in the service industry has been rising in recent years, and it has become a net exporter in many service sectors.

The future development and trade of the service industry should focus more on digital services. In this field, China has relatively advanced infrastructure and offers some new approaches. In the post-COVID-19 era, precision targeting, which provides targeted services based on the specific needs of different enterprises and individuals, will be more efficient.

The impact of the pandemic on different economic entities has shown significant heterogeneity. Auto mechanics have been more affected than accountants who can work remotely, and the catering industry has been hit much harder than the e-commerce industry.

Unified policy measures are difficult to meet the significantly different needs of various economic entities. Some companies face solvency issues, while others only face liquidity problems; some need extended loan terms, while others may need tax cuts, rent reductions, or lower interest expenses. More targeted responses will improve rescue efficiency, reduce government bailout and subsidy costs, and more effectively prevent fundamentally sound companies from going bankrupt due to short-term shocks.

In China, large, medium, and small enterprises, consumers, and economic entities from different sectors and regions have already begun to migrate to the digital space. In terms of building a digital ecosystem, most places in the world lag behind China. Big data covering transactions, operations, business income, consumer spending, and past credit records creates conditions for providing more precise credit support, reducing credit costs, extending loan terms, and increasing loan amounts.

This can help healthcare workers obtain free medical insurance and life insurance subsidies; make it easier for foreign trade companies to obtain trade credit; and help small and micro enterprises digitize their operations, improve efficiency, and gain access to previously unattainable credit.

Information asymmetry is the root cause of various financial frictions. Big data and precision targeting based on it can help alleviate this problem. Thanks to advances in financial technology, within a large digital ecosystem, credit allocation can be more inclusive, and default rates can be controlled.

During the pandemic, China's digital services not only helped reduce economic and financial costs but also helped protect lives and public safety. Cloud computing and health codes have played positive roles. The biggest obstacles to the development and trade of the service industry are still various entry restrictions. At this point, the financial services industry needs competition from foreign "catfish," and so do the healthcare, education, and entertainment industries.

Promoting the opening up and fair competition in these sectors will not only improve productivity, create growth and employment opportunities, but also provide significant welfare benefits to the growing middle-class consumers. The middle class is no longer satisfied with the consumption of necessities; the new fashion is health, lifestyle, and higher quality of life. The reshaping and trade of the service industry will help China, which is moving towards a middle-income society, meet the increasingly discerning demands of consumers.
