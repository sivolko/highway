> In the network era, the extent of a country's connections is as important as its economic scale. While strengthening itself through connections, it should also enhance other nodes in the network.

Those hoping for a quick US-China trade agreement need to calm down and wait patiently. A successful negotiation often requires both parties to understand each other's perspectives.

Currently, China is deeply convinced that the US intends to suppress and prevent China's rise. This belief may not only be based on commercial and economic considerations but also on civilizational hostility.

After the consensus reached by the US and Chinese leaders at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, at the end of June, and the resumption of negotiations in early July, China's overall strategy in this trade dispute has been to take a low-key approach. The Chinese have realized that in the early stages of the US-China trade dispute, eagerness to reach an agreement made China appear vulnerable, inviting further attacks.

Now, China has witnessed the Trump administration's relentless approach in negotiations: in May this year, despite China making a series of concessions in the previous round of talks, the US still threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese exports; even with the resumption of US-China trade negotiations, the already imposed tariffs have not been lifted.

In the US-China trade dispute, China can adopt a "wait and see" strategy based on two judgments:

First, President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs and belligerent behavior towards multiple countries could severely impact the US economy, forcing him to make some concessions before the 2020 US presidential election.

Second, Trump's recent claim of a major victory in negotiations with Mexico is at best a show to ease growing market anxiety. The latest "US-Mexico agreement" is almost entirely based on previous agreements. The so-called Mexican concessions exist only in Trump's tweets. In any case, the prevailing market anxiety could force the US to change its tough stance at any time, and China has no reason to rush to make concessions and appease the situation.

More importantly, given that Chinese leaders suspect the Trump administration's true intention is to suppress China's economy rather than reach an agreement, China should be prepared for the possibility of trade negotiations breaking down again.

China has already taken a series of countermeasures to mitigate the economic impact of US-China trade friction, which has also led to a certain degree of RMB depreciation, partially offsetting the negative impact of US tariffs on the Chinese economy.

Domestically, a common view is that the US's advantage in trade and tariffs will be offset by China's willingness to make short-term sacrifices in the face of external pressure. This view has been further reinforced after the widely publicized history of US-Japan trade conflicts in the 1980s.

As Sun Tzu's Art of War says, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." For years, Chinese policymakers have been closely monitoring US domestic political dynamics and are well aware that Trump is exploiting deep-rooted anti-China sentiments in American society.

Therefore, in the context of prolonged US-China trade friction, China needs not only to adjust domestic economic policies and prepare for self-sufficiency but also to make new allies and appease former adversaries.

Currently, China is striving to improve Sino-Japanese relations. Thanks to Trump, Sino-Russian relations are also becoming closer. Without the tacit approval of Russian leaders, the "Belt and Road" initiative across Eurasia would be difficult to fully advance. One sign of deepening Sino-Russian cooperation is that a natural gas pipeline originally destined for Japan has been redirected to China.

At present, Western liberalism is under suspicion. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, Western countries have experienced slow economic recovery, with life expectancy for some groups even declining, and living standards stagnating. The traditional Western alliance has disintegrated. China is also continuously monitoring these changes.

However, China cannot completely abandon its economic ties with the US. At some point, China will need to contribute to the global trade system commensurate with the benefits it receives. This means China needs to significantly increase imports and strictly protect intellectual property rights. But in the short term, it is unrealistic to expect China to change its laws or abandon its current development model as demanded by the Trump administration.

The US should also learn to consider issues from China's perspective. With 5,000 years of civilization, the Chinese understand that those eager to reach an agreement will be at a disadvantage in negotiations; those who remain patient and appear less urgent will gain the most benefits.
