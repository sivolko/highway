> In the network era, the extent of a country's connections is as important as its economic scale. While strengthening itself through connections, it should also enhance other nodes in the network.

Modern China's isolation has led to the misconception that China does not like to connect and interact with the outside world. In fact, inclusiveness and openness are core elements of traditional Chinese culture. China has long been a highly open society, adept at absorbing foreign cultures and ideas, and highly inclusive.

During the Western Han Dynasty, Zhang Qian's expedition to the Western Regions opened up the Silk Road, strengthening economic and cultural exchanges between the Han Dynasty and the Western Regions. Buddhism was introduced to China from India and spread to the Central Plains through the Silk Road. By the time of Emperor Ming of the Eastern Han Dynasty in 67 AD, Buddhism had received official recognition and eventually took root deeply in China.

China is also skilled at integrating foreign cultures, transforming them into something uniquely Chinese. Before the introduction of Buddhism, Taoism, which originated in China, was prevalent, and Confucianism was the mainstay of Chinese civilization. After Buddhism was introduced to China, it was to some extent sinicized, resulting in a subtle integration with Confucianism.

The Ming and Qing Dynasties are often considered periods of isolation, marking the beginning of China's lag behind Western powers. However, during this time, there was still some awareness of external connections and acceptance of new things. A good example is Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, who supported the German missionary Johann Adam Schall von Bell's calendar through humble learning.

In today's network era, how should China define its identity to become a winner in the next stage of globalization?

In a network environment, the centrality of a country's node in the entire network, that is, the extent of its connections, is as important as its economic scale. Luxembourg is a small country but a key node in Europe's and even the world's financial and capital networks. The scale of capital inflows and outflows in Luxembourg exceeds that of any other European country. Over 100 years ago, Luxembourg was the poorest country in Europe; today, it is one of the countries with the highest per capita income in Europe.

China can become the node with the most connections in the global network, or the best-connected node in the global network, by building modern infrastructure, aligning its technology and standards with the world, and shortening the distance with other economies and their people.

In a network system, the main players and their connections are very important. Using protectionist measures and isolationist attitudes to cut off connections with other countries will only reduce one's influence on the world stage.

China should be the leader and protector of the global network system. This role requires China to help other countries develop while strengthening itself through connections, ensuring that other nodes in the network are also strengthened, achieving mutual prosperity.

While promoting large-scale openness, China also needs to consider the spillover effects of its actions on other economies and the spillback effects of other economies on China. Any large ship sailing forward will create a strong wake, causing turbulence for nearby ships.

When a major country's exposure to the international financial system increases, other countries' exposure to that major economy also increases. China's policy directions, asset prices, or exchange rate fluctuations can have a huge impact on global markets, as evidenced by the recent surge in Bitcoin prices.

The progress of connecting China's stock and bond markets with other countries, the inclusion of Chinese stocks in global indices, more Chinese investors and companies incorporating overseas assets into their global asset allocation, and various domestic developments in China will have a greater impact on overseas markets, the global economic situation, and even the livelihoods of ordinary people in other countries.

The Federal Reserve rarely considers the impact on other countries when making policies, even if its decisions cause shocks to other countries. China's policy-making should continue to focus on domestic issues but also consider the spillover effects of its policies, including the impact on relatively fragile emerging market economies. Otherwise, China's policies could bring volatility risks to itself. The spillover and spillback effects were very evident during the large-scale quantitative easing implemented by the US and Europe.

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 75th anniversary of the Bretton Woods system. Greater openness requires better coordination and cooperation with other economies. Only in this way can economic and financial globalization play a better role.
