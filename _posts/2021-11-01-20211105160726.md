Many developed countries today face the greatest challenge of the divide between the elite and grassroots classes, leading to widespread distrust of the government. Over the past 40 years, the real income of the middle class has barely grown, and the next generation is likely to be worse off than their parents. In 1975, 90% of people earned more than their parents, but today that figure has fallen to less than 50%. Therefore, the goal of "common prosperity" proposed by Chinese leaders is of profound significance, aiming to address this issue ahead of Western countries.

The advocacy of integrating prosperity (which can also be understood as efficiency) with fairness is commendable, but some key points need to be clarified. First, not all inequality is bad. Some people choose to work hard, while others choose to spend time lounging on the beach; they should not receive the same income or enjoy the same level of consumption. Chinese culture values labor and sees diligence as a virtue, making it unlikely to become a large welfare state like some Nordic countries.

Not all wealthy individuals are the same. There is a vast difference between Russian oligarchs who became billionaires by acquiring state assets before privatization and billionaires like Bill Gates who drive significant technological innovation. Society needs wealthy individuals who change people's lives and society through innovation and entrepreneurship.

The way wealthy individuals use their wealth also varies. Trump uses his wealth to gain political influence and television exposure, while Buffett lives frugally and uses his investment wisdom to help many companies grow. Buffett's wealth drives innovation and economic growth, creating jobs and wealth for more people through the trickle-down effect. Therefore, it is unwise to indiscriminately punish the wealthy; we still need their seasoned experience to identify successful enterprises and provide funding for small and startup businesses.

What truly needs to be done is to eliminate unjust inequality, such as market entry barriers, unfair competition, excessive market monopolies, and practices that harm workers' rights. Some wealthy individuals hide vast amounts of wealth in low-tax or tax-haven locations. The lower tax rates on capital income compared to labor income also give asset owners an unfair advantage.

We also need to think more broadly about equality beyond income and wealth. In this regard, pre-distribution is important. After birth, can a person access free and quality education, healthcare, and social infrastructure? Can they rely on support in retirement? Common prosperity aims to improve the living standards of the vast majority of people. From this perspective, many measures can be planned.

First, companies that abuse power should be punished. This phenomenon is most evident in the United States, where powerful corporations and lobbying groups can influence policies in their favor. Large companies like Facebook (now Meta) often do not receive the penalties they deserve. This has caused many deep-seated issues in society, such as facilitating terrorist organizations to incite violence and spreading false information that manipulates consumer and voter preferences.

Second, to improve social mobility, people should be allowed to move relatively freely and conveniently. Places with higher social mobility often have better innovation and development. To some extent, changing environments is often an opportunity for the poor to escape unfortunate circumstances and a chance to leave unfavorable environments and achieve success. Additionally, countries should consider raising tax rates on capital gains and carried interest, especially intensifying efforts to combat tax evasion.

Third, countries should encourage corporate innovation and research and development. It is particularly important that, despite the direction of technological development towards machine labor replacement, China should still strive to create jobs and encourage companies to use more labor rather than capital, such as encouraging the use of clean energy over capital-intensive traditional fossil fuels. Of course, climate change and its responses will also bring a series of new inequality issues that require more attention and research.

In summary, common prosperity is a broader pursuit than merely reducing income inequality or taxing the wealthiest 1% for redistribution. Indeed, China should not allow most of its wealth to fall into the hands of a few, but it should also recognize that reducing wealth at the top of the pyramid will not automatically and significantly improve the living standards of the rest of society in a sustainable way.

Common prosperity requires a comprehensive set of measures, from pre-distribution to redistribution, to build a fairer society that does not need to be completely equal, ensuring that most people have the opportunity to live a decent and dignified life.

Whether Western countries or China will be the first to achieve this goal may be the most important global competition in the coming decades.
