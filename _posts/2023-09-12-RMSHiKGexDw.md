Recently, there have been voices in the Western media predicting the decline of the Chinese economy. Some politicians and media outlets make sweeping judgments based on isolated, partial, and short-term data fluctuations, exaggerating the temporary challenges in China's economic development, attempting to dampen confidence and lower expectations. In this context, there are still economists who offer objective and rational views. Jin Keyu, the youngest tenured professor of economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, primarily researches international macroeconomics and the Chinese economy. She is a significant Chinese voice capable of making waves in the core circles of Western influence. Recently, she published a new book, "The New China Playbook," which attempts to provide an objective and comprehensive introduction to the growth of the Chinese economy and clarify common misconceptions and myths about the Chinese economy in the Western world.
