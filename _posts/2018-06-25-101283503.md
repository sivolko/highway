Nearly three years after the implementation of the "comprehensive two-child policy," China is expected to completely abolish the family planning policy. Is this enough to change the situation of China's gradually losing demographic dividend?

Currently, China's total fertility rate (hereinafter referred to as the fertility rate) is around 1.6. From the current stage of development, this level is too low. Data shows that in countries with a per capita income of around $10,000, the average fertility rate is usually above 2. Without immigration, the fertility rate needed to maintain a stable population is 2.1.

Imagine, in ordinary families with a fertility rate below 2, is the "two-child policy" reasonable? The answer is no, because the "two-child policy" restricts families who want to have more than two children, but has no effect on families who only want one child or no children. The reasoning for the "three-child policy" being unreasonable is similar. Such policies will cause the fertility rate to fall below the level that people spontaneously desire.

Completely abolishing the family planning policy may slightly increase the fertility rate, but historical experience shows that the decline in fertility rates is difficult to reverse. In China, there are many factors that inhibit the willingness of urban populations to have children, such as high education costs and high housing prices. According to surveys, the expenditure on a child's education in urban Chinese families already accounts for about 25% of the total household expenditure.

Moreover, Chinese companies' employment preferences are not conducive to female fertility. Many companies do not like to hire women who may have another child in the next few years. Therefore, in a sense, the introduction of the "two-child policy" has put women at a greater disadvantage in the workplace.

The decline in fertility rates is a global issue. In 1960, the global average number of children per family was about 5, but today this number is less than 2.5. South Korea's fertility rate is among the lowest in the world, having dropped to 1.24. Why is this? Many factors are very similar to China's current realityâ€”high education costs, high housing prices, and a lack of affordable, high-quality childcare services.

Some countries have been very successful in encouraging childbirth, and France is an example. For a long period starting in the 1960s, France's fertility rate declined rapidly, but in recent years it has stabilized at a level where each woman has 1.8-2 children. Why did this change occur?

France has provided a lot of economic support for childbirth through welfare, social assistance, and subsidies for poor families. For ordinary families, the regulations on maternity leave are very generous and apply to both parents. After the child is born, the working father or mother can take up to three years of leave, and after the leave ends, they can return to the same or a similar position with the same employer. Since maternity leave applies to both men and women, there are many "househusbands" in France.

However, the most effective way to encourage childbirth is to provide childcare services. This allows women to stay in the workforce better. The Swedish government provides a lot of public childcare services, and the maternity leave period is also long, making it easier to raise children in Sweden than in other countries.

There are also some countries where the government has few measures to encourage childbirth, such as the United States. But the U.S. fertility rate has stabilized at around 1.7. Culture, especially the emphasis on family, plays a key role.

This also reminds us to think about whether the long-term family planning policy has fundamentally changed the family structure of Chinese society. People may have become accustomed to smaller families, and the traditional concept of large families has disappeared.

In the past, a family had many children, and the children would take care of their parents. In 2009, half of the income of retired parents came from their children; among people aged 45-60, half expected that most of their income after retirement would come from their children.

But today, people no longer hold the idea that they will rely entirely on their children in old age. The idea that having more children will provide more support in old age is slowly changing. The family structure of Chinese society, and even the Confucian thinking paradigm, has disappeared in just a few decades.

Raising China's fertility rate is a huge challenge. Abolishing the family planning policy is a welcome move, but it may not be enough. Considering strengthening childcare services and providing more security for working women is no longer premature. The strong competitive tendency in Chinese society is causing education costs to rise to levels that ordinary families cannot afford.

Changing fertility preferences takes time, so starting some initiatives now is not too early.
