On January 19, 2024, at the Davos-Klosters Convention Center in Switzerland, the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting held a session on "Decrypting the US-China Relationship."

In a meeting in November 2023, US President Joe Biden and Chinese leaders pledged to re-establish military contacts and cooperate on climate change. As competition continues, the two countries need to find new modes of coordination.

How will US-China relations develop in the coming year?

The World Economic Forum is an international organization for public-private cooperation, bringing together leaders from various sectors to set the agenda. The 54th Annual Meeting will focus on transparency, consistency, and accountability, welcoming government representatives from over 100 countries, major international organizations, forum partners, and leaders from various sectors.
