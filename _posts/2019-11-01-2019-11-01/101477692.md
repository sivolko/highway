> Post-Brexit, the UK will still primarily trade with Europe, but Brexit also presents opportunities for future economic and trade cooperation between China and the UK.

Associate Professor of Economics, London School of Economics and Political Science

Recently, the EU once again extended the Brexit negotiation deadline to January 31 of next year. How will Brexit affect the future trade patterns between China, Europe, and the UK? At the 2019 China Development Forum Special Session, Associate Professor Jin Keyu from the London School of Economics and Political Science gave us an exclusive interview.

Jin Keyu believes that post-Brexit, the UK will still primarily trade with Europe, but Brexit also presents opportunities for future economic and trade cooperation between China and the UK.

Regarding the impact of economic globalization, she believes that the network relationships of the economy and technology have restructured the previous vertical hierarchical relationships. The relationships between major powers need to be redefined. The focus now is on becoming a component of connections, becoming part of a very tight network. Any action that disrupts this network will harm everyone.

## The UK's Main Trade Partner Post-Brexit Will Still Be Europe

CDF: How will Brexit affect future China-UK relations?

Jin Keyu: This opens up potential cooperation opportunities between China and the UK because the UK now needs a very friendly trade environment more than ever. I believe the UK is very interested in cooperating with China in trade and investment. We also see that despite recent turmoil, Chinese investment in the UK continues. So this is an opportunity.

Nevertheless, we all know that trade is highly correlated with distance. If the distance increases, trade decreases. The UK's main trade partner in the future, regardless, will still be Europe. However, in China's external projects, such as the "Belt and Road Initiative," the UK can be more proactive in participating in areas like technology and finance.

CDF: How will this change Europe? Will the relationship between the EU and China, as well as internal EU relations, change? Will the EU become more unified in political and economic policies?

Jin Keyu: China once viewed London as a gateway to Europe, but now the situation has changed, which will certainly have a negative impact on London. When China considers bond connect, stock connect, and other financial interconnections, they will ask, is it Paris or Frankfurt? Previously, the answer was undoubtedly London. China will do more business with Europe, not London.

I think Brexit has a much smaller impact on Europe itself. All of Europe's past chronic issues will still exist, political problems, economic coordination problems, these issues will exist whether the UK is an EU member or not. But it does involve a bigger issue, that without political, fiscal, and banking unions, even from an economic perspective, it is not feasible. This has nothing to do with whether the UK is in the EU or not.

## Economic Networks Replace National Relationships

CDF: You previously mentioned that economic networks are replacing national relationships, redefining the world order. How should we understand this change?

Jin Keyu: Everything is a network now. Technology is a network, it is built on networks. Even the English language is a network, supply chains are networks. We are in a network era.

There is an interesting analogy, tracing back to 15th century Florence, the Medici family was not the most powerful, nor the wealthiest, but in the family network, they were the most connected.

Because they were at the center of the network, they gained great glory, reputation, and political influence. Network relationships have replaced these hierarchical relationships. Horizontal networks have replaced vertical networks or vertical relationships, and we must understand this.

So when we talk about great power politics, what does it mean to be a great power? Does it mean you set the rules and other countries follow, like the US? It is no longer like that. The focus is on the components of connections, on becoming part of a very tight network. Any action that disrupts this network will harm everyone, including themselves. So we need to redefine the meaning of great power relationships.

CDF: China is at the center of the manufacturing network, so is there some kind of imbalance between China's economic strength and international influence?

Jin Keyu: Emerging market countries generally lack a voice and strong presence in the international system and framework because they were not present when the rules were made, they did not participate. But in fact, they account for half of the world's economic scale. So this is not just China's problem, it is also a problem for many other developing countries and emerging market countries. Of course, as we see in China's case, as the economic scale expands, other aspects of influence will also become stronger, such as political and geopolitical influence.

But then again, China is still not a true economic power because its actual income is still very low. As you can see, when the WTO coordinates disputes, it is clear that emerging markets have not played an important role in setting the rules of the game. The WTO did not anticipate that emerging markets could actually graduate. That is the problem. That is China's problem. The WTO says, we set the rules because you will always be developing countries. But then a great power graduated, and they did not know what to do. So developing countries need to speak up together.

## Distinguishing Where Government Is Effective and Ineffective

CDF: How do you evaluate China's development model?

Jin Keyu: I think the first element of China's development model is the unabashed use of state capacity, state resources, and state coordination capabilities. But we must very carefully distinguish where this is effective and where it is not so effective.

It is very effective in creating a friendly business environment, China has done very well in this regard, attracting foreign companies, establishing the right environment, and also benefiting the booming development of domestic enterprises. In addition, providing infrastructure, basic education, and healthcare. The capacity, competence, and efficiency of the Chinese government in this regard are rare in other developing countries. This is also something many countries envy. Providing a basic environment for private entities to utilize and thrive. So I think state capacity is very crucial.

Additionally, even before 1979, the government played a significant role in developing industry, improving literacy rates, and public health. In 1949, India and China started at the same level, but by 1979, China was far ahead in many indicators such as welfare.

What are the less effective aspects of the government? We have historical experience from China and other countries, which is picking winners, selecting strategies, and betting on industries.

There is no reason to believe that the government will be more capable or have more information in this regard than the private sector, or that it can make better decisions than the market. Therefore, we must have a very careful distinction about what the state can and cannot do.

Some sectors' industrial policies may be viewed from a security perspective rather than an economic one. This should not be ignored. But I think, from an economic perspective, at least research and data tell us that industrial policy is mixed.

Industrial policy combined with other policies may be more effective than a single policy or just opening up. Because many countries have different outcomes after trade liberalization. It is the combined effect of a series of policies. But industrial policy itself has not been proven effective, whether in China, or in past Japan, South Korea, and other countries.

Just like opening up trade, you must first ensure that a large number of jobs are secured, ensuring they will be transferred to high-tech industries, rather than staying in a low-skill, low-productivity equilibrium. It is a combination of a series of policies.

Overall, letting the market decide who will be the winners and in which areas to trade may be a better choice.
