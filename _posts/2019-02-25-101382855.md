> Becoming a core part of the globally connected world will give China greater influence and a more secure position.

Many countries are skeptical of China's increasingly active efforts on the global stage, viewing it as an attempt by China to become another world hegemon. This perception greatly hinders China's well-intentioned efforts. China does not seek to become another world hegemon.

In this new era of global connectivity, global leadership is no longer about a superpower setting the rules for all other countries to follow, but about a superpower initiating and expanding global networks and ensuring their effective protection.

Compared to the past, today's world is forming increasingly tight networks, whether in technology, companies, banks, or global supply chains.

Whether addressing global climate change, improving the international financial system, or global supply chains, these efforts have strong transnational attributes. Even pressing challenges like technological displacement of workers and artificial intelligence replacing humans are not issues that a single country can solve independently; they require coordination and cooperation between countries.

The global economy is more interconnected and intertwined than ever before. Substitution and competition are giving way to complementarity and cooperation.

As technology advances and trade costs decrease, the cheap labor of developing countries has become an important asset; Middle Eastern oil, which was almost useless 150 years ago, is now a crucial input for global production; rhodium and lithium are now highly valuable because the world needs batteries to power electric vehicles.

Networks and connectivity make the unique resources and products of each country more valuable, which in turn makes the entire network and channels of connection more valuable. We are no longer in a zero-sum game world but in a world where the welfare of one country can directly affect the welfare of another.

This means that connectivity is more important than ever. Initiatives like the "Belt and Road" help establish connections between countries and accelerate their economic development.

Azerbaijan produces delicious black caviar. Without transportation connections, locals would still be consuming it as a means of obtaining protein. Now, black caviar can be sold at astonishing prices to other parts of the world, allowing Azerbaijanis to live more prosperous lives.

However, establishing connections internationally is difficult, with many cross-border frictions and distortions from politics, information, and incentives. Smaller or poorer countries may lack the capacity and funds to build these transportation connections. At this point, major powers can provide necessary assistance, absorb some of the risks, and mitigate these distortions. China should position itself as a supporter and leader of global networks.

Can a country or group at the center of the network sometimes be better than the most powerful?

There are historical examples: In 14th century Italy, the Medici family in Florence was neither the wealthiest nor the most politically powerful, but through family marriages, economic relationships, and political patronage, it became the most central part of the Italian family network. This family is ultimately regarded as the "father of the Renaissance," leaving all other families behind in history.

China becoming the most central part of the modern connected world also benefits itself.

Firstly, in an interconnected and open network world, China may benefit more than any other country. Not only can open trade and open information infrastructure utilize China's technology, but it can also enhance its ability to influence global cooperation initiatives, such as multilateral development banks and climate change responses.

Additionally, by embedding itself into the global system and becoming an indispensable part, China can secure a safer positionâ€”not being expelled from the global system simply because the United States feels threatened by China's rise.

Compared to traditional competition and confrontation with the United States, becoming a global network leader can give China greater influence and higher security.

However, this also means that China must bear greater costs to support the global network, just as the United States bears more than half of NATO's defense spending.

As the United States further sheds its important responsibilities on the international stage, China should do the opposite. China's mission should not only be to become the world's largest economy or a wealthy economy but also to recognize the responsibility and rewards of building a network that helps other countries prosper.
