During the second Bund Summit on October 24, 2020, Associate Professor Jin Keyu from the London School of Economics and Political Science asked former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair questions about international relations, including China-Europe and US-China relations. Blair stated that Europeans hope to promote relations with China rather than adopt a Cold War mentality. On security issues, the US and Europe will always maintain a close transatlantic relationship. He believes that Europe can play a role in shaping more productive US-China dialogue, and the UK should also be involved. Blair emphasized that the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century is the US-China relationship, even without considering Europe. He also pointed out that engaging with China is in Europe's interest and is of great significance.
