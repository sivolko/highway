> Global factors are causing the timing of credit growth in various countries to converge. The spillover effects of central country monetary policies are stronger than before, making it difficult for emerging market countries to control capital flows with domestic policies.

Recently, several emerging market countries have experienced turbulence, reminiscent of the major systemic crises triggered by the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes in the 1980s and 1990s, and the "taper tantrum" in 2013 when the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing led to financial deterioration in emerging markets such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey.

These situations are increasingly related to the "global financial cycle" phenomenon, which has been increasingly mentioned in academia in recent years. As countries' economies become more interconnected on a financial level, this is becoming an increasingly evident pattern.

The global financial cycle refers to the phenomenon where global factors cause the timing of credit growth in various countries to converge, especially with asset prices fluctuating synchronously worldwide. This has a series of important implications for the global economy.

Firstly, this means that the spillover effects of central country (e.g., the United States) monetary policies are more rapid and powerful than before. The extensive layout of global banks in various countries and the increasing number of international branches set up by domestic banks facilitate the rapid transmission of credit conditions globally.

If the United States loosens its monetary policy, asset prices rise, bank leverage increases, and credit conditions ease, then domestic companies' borrowing costs will decrease. Conversely, if the United States tightens its monetary policy, risk appetite decreases, and credit contracts, capital will withdraw from emerging markets, usually causing chaos.

Secondly, the global financial cycle means that many countries' credit booms and busts are no longer under the control of domestic policymakers. If credit supply is largely determined by the Federal Reserve, then policymakers in emerging markets may find it very difficult to control capital inflows and outflows.

Can adopting a floating exchange rate system change this situation? The answer is no. Most emerging market countries are painstakingly introducing various capital control measures, which may be their only effective option to isolate the impact of U.S. monetary policy shocks, but achieving timely and appropriate control is very difficult.

Thirdly, the value of the U.S. dollar is becoming increasingly important. A strong dollar can be detrimental to emerging markets, not only because a strong dollar coupled with higher interest rates imposes a heavy debt burden on those who have borrowed in dollar-denominated debt, but also because it can further deteriorate credit conditions.

The reason is that these economies typically borrow in dollars but have assets denominated in local currency. When the local currency depreciates, the liabilities relative to assets increase, weakening the balance sheet and worsening credit conditions, which in turn affects investment and economic activity. The days of boosting exports through currency depreciation to achieve economic expansion may be over; the impact of financial channels is likely to become more dominant, adversely affecting the economy.

Finally, the global financial cycle severely constrains domestic monetary policy. If the Federal Reserve chooses to tighten monetary policy, other countries must either follow suit to prevent their currency from depreciating or adopt more accommodative policies to buffer against the tightening of overseas monetary policy.

The first option may trigger a domestic economic recession due to higher interest rates, while the second option may lead to undesirable economic overheating. Neither is a good option. Does this mean that the current round of Federal Reserve monetary tightening will inevitably lead to turbulence in emerging markets? Not necessarily.

The Federal Reserve has recently improved its communication, taking investor expectations into account. Moreover, not all emerging market countries are the same. Those with stronger economic fundamentals, lower inflation and debt-to-GDP ratios, and smaller current account deficits filled by dollar debt will be better able to withstand external credit tightening; countries with more monetary and fiscal policy space to stabilize the economy will also be better positioned.

In fact, for Argentina, the recent problems are not due to monetary policy but fiscal policy. Massive fiscal spending has shaken investor confidence and exposed the inherent vulnerabilities of its economy.

So far, the global financial cycle has had little impact on China. Recent credit booms in China have been driven entirely by domestic factors rather than external conditions. Although monetary policy normalization is a gradual process and relatively moderate in intensity, rising interest rates will still prompt the long-delayed adjustment of asset prices in China.
