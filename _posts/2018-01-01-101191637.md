> Global infrastructure has network effects, connecting some key nodes requires the participation of external entities, and the "Belt and Road Initiative" can provide critical input.

In today's world, many parts of the economy operate like networks. When the network is largest and most extensive, its productivity is highest. This network effect is often used to describe the value of platforms like Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, and Didi. In fact, network effects also apply to supply chains and can be used to describe infrastructure.

For an infrastructure network, its value is greatest only when cross-national and cross-regional connections are relatively complete. Imagine transporting goods from inland western China to Europe. If Central Asian countries do not have rail connections, the infrastructure networks within China and Europe cannot fully realize their value.

Take Africa as another example. Although Kenya's ports are modern and efficient, if railways or highways cannot connect Angola with Kenya, Angola's underground mineral resources can only stay within the country and cannot be exported.

Only when a relatively complete global infrastructure network is established can it bring the greatest value and externalities, and each segment of the infrastructure network can maximize its value.

This concerns how we understand the "Belt and Road Initiative" and how to promote this concept to the world. There are many criticisms of the "Belt and Road Initiative" overseas, leading to some political backlash. There is suspicion about China's goals, whether it is to enhance political and military influence, export excess capacity, or something else.

Regardless of the true motives behind the "Belt and Road Initiative," the most important thing is for China to provide convincing reasons and arguments from an economic perspective on why the initiative is necessary and beneficial to all parties.

The network effect of infrastructure is such an argument. It tells us that some strategically positioned countries, due to poverty, lack the ability to build infrastructure or connect it with neighboring countries' infrastructure. Therefore, other countries or organizations must help them complete this task and connect these key nodes.

Many reasons can explain why this work requires external participation, such as lack of funds, lack of domestic coordination and cooperation capabilities, lack of regulatory capabilities, lack of political relations with neighboring countries, or simply lack of willingness.

The external participants in this work first need to have sufficient funds to bear the high initial costs and start building the infrastructure network. They also need to be able to bear various risks, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and construction risk, and have a long-term investment and strategic perspective.

The United States' domestic infrastructure has lagged behind for 30 years, partly because the two parties have not reached a consensus. If the U.S. struggles domestically, it is hard to expect it to coordinate different countries and regions, effectively allocate funds, and build an infrastructure network. China, on the other hand, can provide the aforementioned critical inputs.

If China should play the role of the external participant, the next question is how much China should spend on the "Belt and Road Initiative."

I think it can be compared to NATO. China's role in the global infrastructure network can be compared to the role the U.S. plays in the North Atlantic security network. The U.S. contributes far more funds to NATO than its national size would require. One key reason is that only if the U.S. bears a large share will other countries contribute the remaining part. If the U.S. does not make a significant contribution and commitment, the alliance might not form. Therefore, to some extent, the U.S. bears most of the cost to avoid paying the full amount.

China faces a similar situation. The global infrastructure network can promote trade and reduce trade costs, and China will inevitably be one of the biggest beneficiaries. China's large investment in global infrastructure is compatible with the benefits it will ultimately receive. By making significant investments to start the international cooperation platform, China can avoid paying for all infrastructure projects, which it cannot and should not aim to do.

How to promote the "Belt and Road Initiative" is crucial for China to gain support and recognition from other countries. If we can provide convincing reasons to argue that if China does not take the lead in providing global public goods, the public welfare behind it may be ignored and never met, then other countries' suspicions will be reduced. China's efforts will also face lower costs and become more efficient.
