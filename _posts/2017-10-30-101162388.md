> Technology, rather than globalization, is the main cause of unemployment and stagnation in middle-class income growth; globalization and technology are intertwined, and elites need to better manage the impacts of globalization and technology.

At the recently concluded International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank annual meetings, the most discussed topic was how to address the challenges of globalization. Today, from free trade to the free flow of capital, people, and even information, globalization is being obstructed in almost every aspect. A survey by The Economist magazine shows that in developed economies, less than 50% of people believe that globalization is a positive force.

We must admit that globalization has its dilemmas. Developing countries could have become the biggest beneficiaries by exporting agricultural products, but to this day, the agricultural sector remains one of the most protected sectors globally. The effects of trade agreements are still highly asymmetric. People often confuse the benefits of trade agreements with the benefits of trade itself, surprised that not all trade agreements benefit all parties involved.

Ideological challenges also exist. If globalization allows influential large corporations and Wall Street to profit more, then the priority of improving the welfare of people in developing countries will be pushed back.

Recently, citizens of wealthy countries have become the strongest opponents of globalization. Technological advancements have segmented the industrial chain into different parts, with some products being produced in South Korea and Japan, while others rely on Mexico. This means that profits generated by companies like Apple are distributed worldwide, not just in the United States.

Globalization supporters would argue that those ignorant consumers do not realize that their income can buy more toys, clothes, and furniture precisely because these are imported from China.

Unfortunately, this is not the perspective held by the majority of people in the global economy. On one hand, they see their compatriots losing jobs, and on the other hand, they see elites who label themselves as global citizens using open capital accounts to move trillions of dollars to offshore accounts to avoid taxes and regulations. They do not see elites caring about the interests of ordinary people. Compared to globalization lifting countries like India and China out of poverty, they care more about the fact that they are being left behind by their wealthier compatriots.

To some extent, they have a reason to be discontent. The world's elites have indeed spent most of their political capital on opening borders and negotiating trade agreements, while doing very little to address the negative impacts of globalization. Some countries are much better at protecting their labor force than others. For example, Germany provides retraining for workers replaced by industrial robots, enabling them to acquire more skills and earn higher wages. Countries like Germany, Denmark, and Sweden have formed unions with significant bargaining power, effectively curbing the political influence of big entrepreneurs and the wealthy.

In fact, most people do not realize that technology, rather than globalization, is the main cause of unemployment and stagnation in middle-class income. This point has been exploited by many politicians. New breakthroughs in sensors, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are currently affecting more jobs. About 75% of jobs in developing countries could be replaced, and 50% of jobs in developed economies are at risk.

Why do people like to blame globalization? Because it concerns "us" versus "them," giving politicians a clear target and opponent. Technology, on the other hand, only concerns "us" versus "robots," which has limited appeal. Compared to the competition and hostility between people, the distribution of interests between humans and robots is less likely to provoke obvious competition and hostility.

However, we should not forget that since the 1990s, globalization has significantly reduced global inequality, allowing developing countries to produce and export products to a broader market, achieving leapfrog development. Will this trend continue? In the face of the threat of technology and automation, when products can be produced at extremely low costs, can today's poor countries still expect to become tomorrow's rich countries? When automation penetrates developed countries and factories return from developing countries to developed countries, will global inequality shift from convergence to divergence?

The world's elites need to better manage the impacts of globalization and work together to address the global threat of technology impacting employment. Globalization and technology are intertwined: technology can make globalization appear in various forms and faces, while globalization provides greater incentives for technological innovation, helping it spread quickly and penetrate deeply. It is hard to say which is more challenging, technology or globalization; both are sources of human troubles and well-being. We need to embed them into the global order without suffocating in their embrace.
